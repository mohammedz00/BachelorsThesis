# Investigating the relationship between Air Pollution & Respiratory Disease using Machine Learning & Satellite Data

Monitoring concentrations of particulate matters (PM) is significant in understanding
the safety of air for normal living conditions. Furthermore, there is clear evidence that
an increase in ambient air pollution results in an increased number of cases for
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [1]. This study aims to analyse the correlation
between predicted concentrations of PM2.5/10 and the number of hospital admissions
for respiratory diseases in England for April 2020/21 using data from remote sensing
satellites and a machine learning prediction model. Precursors and chemical
composition of PM2.5/10 from Sentinel-5P were used alongside auxiliary features in the
analysis. A gradient-boosting model known as Light Gradient-Boosting Machine
(LightGBM) proved to be most suitable in predicting PM2.5/10 concentrations. The
predictions were then used to analyse the correlation with the number of hospital
admissions for respiratory diseases.
The concentrations were well estimated, based upon metrics evaluating model
performance. However, only a weak positive correlation was observed, which may
have been due to limitations including spatial-temporal availability of clinical data,
and the simplifying assumptions made.
